Hold on, you know what, I like that,
Run that music back, yeah, one more time, let me get into it, yeah
Sugarhill, baby
Ah, I like that, there it is
I feel like flowing on this
Master Gee, Big Bank Hank, Wonder Mike
Come on

It's like a dream sometimes and when
You're having big fun it's like a dream sometimes
It's like a dream sometimes and when
You're having big fun it's like a dream sometimes

Ay kids, gather round, let me tell you about a day in the park
A real fun day at the park, you know what I'm sayin'
I know you know what I'm talking about, check it out
Come on, come on

Wonder Mike on the mic and I'm hyper than hype
And I tick and tock when I hip and hop
And I don't stop, that hick-a-dick-ory-duck
Yo, I looked at my arm and checked the clock
And it's time to get the grill hot
Time to make your burgers with the cheese on top
Come on, pass the chip, don't forget the dip
Later on have jello with the cool whip

Don't push me, I can do it myself
Watch how high I can swing myself
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh

It's like a dream sometimes and when
You're having big fun it's like a dream sometimes
It's like a dream sometimes and when
You're having big fun it's like a dream sometimes

Stuff to play on, everywhere
Kids are having big fun, runnin' here, runnin' there
So much to do, so much to see
I know you'd rather be here than just watchin' TV
Not a cloud in the sky, no chance of rain
Later at the picnic you can all play games
Like freeze-tag, yo, hide-and-seek
Yo, count to a hundred but you better not peep

Don't push me, I can do it myself
Watch how high I can swing myself
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh

It's like a dream sometimes and when
You're having big fun it's like a dream sometimes
It's like a dream sometimes and when
You're having big fun it's like a dream sometimes

I check it out 'cause it's about that time
When all the kids come out and the sun shines
And all the birds'll be singin', the bees'll be stingin'
The ice cream truck on our block could be ringin'
This the season, when the weather's pleasin'
So chill, and I tell you the reason
'Cause the wind, the rain and all the cold is gone
And it's time to get your fun on, yo

So don't push me, I can do it myself
Watch how high I can swing myself
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh

It's like a dream sometimes and when
You're having big fun it's like a dream sometimes
Yo, it's like a dream sometimes and when you're
Having big fun it's like a dream sometimes, check it
