I don't have a fun anything now.
I think I'm looking for
But I can't find out.
Everybody says, call me "lazy".
It's great men who are absorbed in something
I went a journey to find something, but I
coudn't find out anything at all.
I'm wasting my time in front of TV today.
I'm wasting for passing time, boring part time
job is waiting me
I'm wasting my time
Ah, give me dream and desire
If it so hard to get. I just wanna get it.
I wanna spend time like a dream
