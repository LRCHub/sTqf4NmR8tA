Home is where I want you to be
When I'm worrying about the days, the days that are coming
Though your destiny is to marry the road
Where you will run and you will roam
Forever and ever

I've got a lot to lose you said
And I'm not gonna win this time
So you stopped, you stopped running

And it feels like a dream
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Make it feel like a dream
We'll be together
Forever and ever
Forever and ever

Stay even when you go away
In your mind or on a plane
I don't mind
Sky turns from golden to black
As I watch you running back into the night
I've got a lot to lose you said
And I'm not gonna win this time
So you stopped, you stopped coming

And it feels like a dream
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Make it feel like a dream
We'll be together
Forever and ever
Forever and ever

How many times
Do I have to tell you
Stop wandering around
You won't do any better
And all of these bullets
That burn through our trenches
They can't hurt us when we're down
Building our own defenses
And even if you tried to see what I'm saying
I call the shots, but babe you build the fences

I hope this is the end of these heavy heavy times

Cause I need a bit of lightness
I need a bit of lightness
