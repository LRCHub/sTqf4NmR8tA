She walks through this house today
Collecting things to be thrown away
Start with love
When he's gone
Now she can move on
'Cos it's only love

And when she's gone
Her hands have drawn
The endless circles
She'll try and run
But she's become
The endless circles

She defies the laws he's laid
Reflections of her heart betrayed
And she'll thank her god
When he's gone
Now she can move on
'Cos it's only love

And when she's gone
Her hands have drawn
The endless circles
She'll try and run
But she's become
The endless circles
Can't find what she's always been searching for
So she moves on...

And everytime you walk away
Remember
How we all move on
Searching for love...
